## Gradient Descent Methods Performance Comparison on Various 2D Contours

### Type of coutours: Saddle surface, Parabolic surface, Rosenbrock function
### Type of methods: SGD, Momentum (Heavy Ball), Nestrov Acclerated Gradient, Adaptive Gradient
Run ```compare_saddle.m```, ```compare_parabolic.m``` or ```compare_rosenbrock.m``` to compare and visualize the optimizaiton trajectories on 3d contours
